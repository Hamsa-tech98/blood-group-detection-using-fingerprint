# Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint

## About the Project
This project focuses on predicting a person’s blood group without collecting blood samples.
Instead, biometric fingerprint images are used along with deep learning techniques to perform
non-invasive blood group classification.

Fingerprint images are processed and analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
which automatically extracts important features and classifies them into different blood group
categories.

This project was developed as an academic project to explore the application of deep learning
and image processing in healthcare-related domains.
